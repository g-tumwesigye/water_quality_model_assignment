## Data Preprocessing
- Load dataset and handle missing values
- Normalize features for better training performance
- Split data into training and testing sets

## Model Training
Each group member defines a unique model with distinct **learning rate, dropout rate, and early stopping criteria**:
- **Jules Gatete**: Adam optimizer with L2 regularization
- **Pascal Mugisha**: RMSprop optimizer with dropout and L2 regularization
- **Geofrey Tumwesigye**: SGD optimizer with momentum

Each model is trained and evaluated separately.

## Model Evaluation
Each member compares their model's performance based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **Loss Analysis**
