## **üìä Model Insights**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Adjustments & Final Optimizations**
- **Class Weights** ‚Üí `Class 1 (Potable)` weight increased to `1.1x` to improve recall.
- **Learning Rate** ‚Üí `0.0002` for smoother convergence and reduced overfitting.
- **Dropout Rate** ‚Üí Lowered to `0.1` to **retain more features** without overfitting.
- **Threshold Selection** ‚Üí  **0.5** for balanced recall-precision trade-off.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Evaluation**
| **Metric**  | **Final Model** |
|------------|---------------|
| **Training Accuracy** | 0.748 |
| **Testing Accuracy**  | 0.640 |
| **F1-Score (Class 1)** | 0.574 |
| **Recall (Class 1)** | 0.619 |
| **Precision (Class 1)** | 0.535 |

## **‚ö° Challenges & Key Learnings**
- **Class Imbalance:** Required **class weight tuning** to improve recall without sacrificing precision.
- **Over-Regularization:** Dropout was **too high initially**, leading to excessive information loss.
- **Threshold Optimization:** Tried **multiple thresholds (0.4, 0.5, 0.6)** to find the best trade-off between recall & precision.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusted **learning rate, dropout, and batch size** for optimal convergence.
