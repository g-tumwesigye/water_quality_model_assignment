# Water Quality Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify water samples as **potable (safe to drink) or non-potable** based on various chemical properties. A **Neural Network** built with **TensorFlow/Keras** is used for classification, with extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best recall-precision balance.

## Dataset
The dataset, `water_potability.csv`, consists of **3,276 water samples** with **9 features**:
- **pH**
- **Hardness**
- **Solids**
- **Chloramines**
- **Sulfate**
- **Conductivity**
- **Organic Carbon**
- **Trihalomethanes**
- **Turbidity**

### ** Data Preprocessing**
- **Handled missing values** by filling them with column means.
- **Standardized features** using `StandardScaler()` to ensure equal weight for all variables.
- **Split dataset** into **70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing**.

## Model Architecture
A **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** was implemented with the following layers:
- **Dense (64 neurons, ReLU, L2 Regularization = 0.007)**
- **Dropout (0.2)**
- **Dense (32 neurons, ReLU, L2 Regularization = 0.007)**
- **Dropout (0.2)**
- **Dense (16 neurons, ReLU, L2 Regularization = 0.007)**
- **Dropout (0.2)**
- **Dense (1 neuron, Sigmoid activation for binary classification)**

### **🛠 Optimization Techniques**
 **Optimizer:** `RMSprop (LR = 0.002)`  
 **Loss Function:** `Binary Crossentropy`  
 **Regularization:** `L2 (0.007)`  
 **Dropout:** `0.2` to prevent overfitting  
 **Class Weighting:** `{0:1, 1:2}` (to balance imbalanced data)  
 **Learning Rate Scheduler:** `ReduceLROnPlateau` (factor = 0.7, patience = 7)  
 **Early Stopping:** `patience = 25` (restores best weights)

## Model Performance
| Metric       | Value  |
|-------------|--------|
| **Test Accuracy**  | **66.46%**  |
| **F1 Score**       | **0.5714**  |
| **Recall**         | **0.5729**  |
| **Precision**      | **0.5699**  |

 **Final model achieved a balanced recall-precision trade-off**, ensuring both potable and non-potable classifications are well-represented.
