## Data Preprocessing
- Load dataset and handle missing values
- Normalize features for better training performance
- Split data into training and testing sets

## Model Training
Each group member defined his model with distinct **learning rate, dropout rate and early stopping criteria**:
- **Jules Gatete**: Adam optimizer with L2 regularization
- **Pascal Mugisha**: SGD optimizer with L2 regularization
- **Geofrey Tumwesigye**:RMSprop optimizer with dropout and L2 regularization
  
## Model Evaluation
Each member compared his model's performance based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **Loss Analysis**
